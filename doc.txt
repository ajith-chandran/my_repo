/**
 * Abstract base class for executing end-to-end agent-side UI tests.
 *
 * <p>This class extends {@code AgentTest} and encapsulates agent-specific test
 * lifecycle behavior, including browser setup, login, metadata tagging, and teardown.
 * It is designed to be used by agent helper classes in cross-system (e.g., agent-consumer)
 * end-to-end test workflows, allowing shared setup across multiple test contexts.</p>
 *
 * <p>Main features:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Initializes browser and agent home page</li>
 *   <li>Manages test metadata such as tags and environment</li>
 *   <li>Performs before/after lifecycle setup with {@code @BeforeClass}, {@code @Before}, and {@code @AfterClass} hooks</li>
 *   <li>Integrates with Costco Travel's internal tagging and environment handling system</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class should not be instantiated directly in tests.
 * Instead, it is intended to be extended by agent helper classes in cross-application flows.</p>
